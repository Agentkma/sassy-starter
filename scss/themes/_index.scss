// Theme Rules
//
// A theme defines colors and images that give your application or site 
// its look and feel. Separating the theme out into its own set of styles 
// allows for those styles to be easily redefined for alternate themes. 
//
// Theme Rules aren't as often used within a project and because of that, 
// they aren't included as part of the core types.
